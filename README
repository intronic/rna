These alignments were prepared using the methods described in the
track description file:
http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg18&g=cons44way
based on the phylogenetic tree: 44way.nh.

Files in this directory:
    - 44way.nh - phylogenetic tree for the phastCons and phyloP calculations
    - commonNames.nh - same as 44way.nh with the UCSC database name
	replace by the common name for the species

The "alignments" directory contains compressed FASTA alignments
for the CDS regions of the human genome (hg18, Mar. 2006) aligned to the 
assemblies.

The maf/chr*.maf.gz files each contain all the alignments to that 
particular human chromosome, with additional annotations to
indicate gap context, genomic breaks, and quality scores for the
sequence in the underlying genome assemblies.

The maf/upstream*.maf.gz files contain alignments in regions upstream of
annotated transcription starts for RefSeq genes with annotated 5' UTRs.
These files differ from the standard MAF format: they display
alignments that extend from start to end of the upstream region in 
human, whether or not alignments actually exist. In situations where no  
alignments exist or the alignments of one or more species are missing, 
dot (".") is used as a placeholder. Multiple regions of an assembly's
sequence may align to a single region in human; therefore, only the 
species name is displayed in the alignment data and no position information 
is recorded. The alignment score is always zero in these files. These files
are updated weekly.

The SiepelLabCorrectedMafs directory contains a masked set of
32-way alignments.  Based on the 44-way, 2x MAFs, and the quality scores, 
the 32 species were extracted.

To download a large file or multiple files from this directory, we recommend 
that you use rsync or ftp rather than downloading the files via our website.
There is approximately 35 Gb of compressed data in this directory.

Via rsync:
rsync -avz --progress \
	rsync://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/multiz44way/ ./

Via FTP:
    ftp hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu 
    user name: anonymous
    password: <your email address>
    go to the directory goldenPath/hg18/multiz44way

To download multiple files from the UNIX command line, use the "mget" command. 
    mget <filename1> <filename2> ...
    - or -
    mget -a (to download all the files in the directory) 
Use the "prompt" command to toggle the interactive mode if you do not want 
to be prompted for each file that you download.

All the files in this directory are freely usable for any 
purpose. For data use restrictions regarding the individual 
genome assemblies, see http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/credits.html.
